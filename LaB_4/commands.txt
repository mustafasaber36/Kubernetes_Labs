11-kubectl get deployments = zero deployments
11-kubectl get replicaset = zero rs 
11-kubectl get all 
12-kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
13- with get rs & get deployment there are one deployment and 1 replicaset
which consists of 3 replicas
14- there are 3 pods within deployment-1 each replicaset has one pods
15- after changing the image to nginx there 3 pods will be terminated and 
3 pods will be created 
-new replicaset will be created and the old one still exists but its has 0 replicas
16-the events : 
Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  5m1s   deployment-controller  Scaled up replica set deployment-1-7b475969d9 to 1
  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  4m57s  deployment-controller  Scaled down replica set deployment-1-577d8f57d5 to 2 from 3
  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  4m57s  deployment-controller  Scaled up replica set deployment-1-7b475969d9 to 2 from 1
  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  4m54s  deployment-controller  Scaled down replica set deployment-1-577d8f57d5 to 1 from 2
  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  4m54s  deployment-controller  Scaled up replica set deployment-1-7b475969d9 to 3 from 2
  Normal  ScalingReplicaSet  4m51s  deployment-controller  Scaled down replica set deployment-1-577d8f57d5 to 0 from 1

16-The StrategyType:  RollingUpdate
17-Rollback the deployment : kubectl rollout undo deployment/deployment-1
17- to see the history of the rollback : kubectl rollout history deployment/deployment-1
17- to see the image fo the deployment : kubectl rollout history deployment/deployment-1  --revision=1
the image will be busybox
18- one the deployment file
====================_LAB_2_===============================
1- kubectl get namespace : 5 namespaces
2-kubectl get pods -n kube-system : 7 pods are running within the kube-system namespace
3-kube create namespace finance
creating the deployment beta from the yaml file...........
4- there is only one node whish is the master and the worker at the same time 
-kubectl get pods -n finance : two pods
-kubectl apply -f limitrange.yml --namespace finance
kubectl delete deployments.apps -n finance beta
